Who is complaining about extreme hot weather? How to monitor and avoid extreme heat in a real-time? What is the spatial distribution of urban heat island? I investigate the urban heat problem extensively with GIS and cyberGIS.

Prediction of Urban Heat Island
======
We predict the urban heat island with fine spatiotemporal granularity within the city of Chicago. Machine learning models are used for the prediction with [Array of Things](https://arrayofthings.github.io/) urban sensing data, and remote sensing data.
