I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student studying Geographical Information Science under [Dr. Shaowen Wang](https://ggis.illinois.edu/directory/profile/shaowen) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). And I joined [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/) and 
[CyberInfrastructure and Geospatial Information Laboratory](https://cigi.illinois.edu/shaowen-wang/home/) since 2018. 

I got my MSc in Geography and GIS from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) on 2021 and BE in Computer Engineering from the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) on 2018. 

My research interests include 1) examine and evaluate the heat dynamics in the urban area with cyberGIS and high-performance geospatial computing; 2) hydrological features extraction using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data; and 3) building scientific gateway for accessing high-performance computer via CyberGIS platform.
