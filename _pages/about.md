I am a ***Computational Geographer*** studying ***Urban Problems***. Currently, I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate studying Geographical Information Science under the amazing [Dr. Shaowen Wang](https://ggis.illinois.edu/directory/profile/shaowen) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). And I also joined [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/) and 
[CyberInfrastructure and Geospatial Information Laboratory](https://cigi.illinois.edu/shaowen-wang/home/) since 2018. 

I got my B.E. in Computer Engineering from the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) in 2018. After undergrad, my interest in maps and spatial analysis brought me to [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), where I got my MSc in Geography and Geographical Information Science in 2021.

My research focuses on the intersection of computational science and urban geography. A common thread in my research is in understanding geospatial problems in urban dynamics, health, and related fields with large geospatial data, remote sensing data, complexity science, and high-performance computing. Another line of my work focuses on remote sensing feature extraction and designing computational solutions with parallel computing and backend advanced infrastructure to approach traditional geospatial problems, including drainage network analysis, spatiotemporal analysis, and etc.
