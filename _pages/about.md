Fangzheng Lyu is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Geography](https://geography.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). He received a Ph.D. in Geography (2024), an M.S. in Geography (2021) from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), and a B.E. in Computer Engineering (2018) from the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). Before joining VT Geography, he worked with Prof. [Shaowen Wang](https://ggis.illinois.edu/directory/profile/shaowen) at the [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital & Spatial Studies](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/) and [Institute for Geospatial Understanding through an Integrative Discovery Environment (I-GUIDE)](https://i-guide.io/).

His research interests are centered around **GIScience**, **Geospatial Data Science** and **Computational Science**, with a particular focus on modeling multi-scale urban climate dynamics using heterogeneous geospatial big data. Specifically, his research work focuses on 1) geospatial data science for understanding multi-scale urban dynamics; 2) scalable spatial algorithms for solving complex geospatial problems; and 3) democratization of cyberGIS for data-intensive geographic research. A common thread in his research is in understanding geospatial problems in urban dynamics, urban planning, health, and related fields with geospatial big data, cyberGIS, geospatial AI and high-performance geospatial computing.

 _I am looking for motivated graduate students interested in pursuing **<font color="red">Ph.D. (joining Fall 2025)</font>** and **<font color="red">M.S. (joining Spring/Fall 2025)</font>** research in Geographic Information Science and Systems, Computational Geography, Urban Informatics, Geospatial AI, and Data-Intensive Geospatial Problem Solving._ Ph.D. students will be fully funded by Research Assistantships, and Master's students will be fully funded by Teaching Assistantships. If interested, please email Fangzheng Lyu (fangzheng@vt.edu). More information on [Master](https://geography.vt.edu/academics/ms-geography.html) and [Ph.D.](https://geography.vt.edu/academics/gea.html) programs is available at [Virginia Tech Geography](https://geography.vt.edu/).
