I was born in Hangzhou, a city located in the southeast coast of China. After 18 years of living in this most beautiful city, I move to Hong Kong where I got my B.E. in Computer Engineering from the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) in 2018. After undergrad, my interest in maps and spatial analysis brought me to [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), where I got my MSc in Geography and Geographical Information Science in 2021 from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Currently, I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student studying Geographical Information Science under the amazing [Dr. Shaowen Wang](https://ggis.illinois.edu/directory/profile/shaowen) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). And I also joined [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/) and 
[CyberInfrastructure and Geospatial Information Laboratory](https://cigi.illinois.edu/shaowen-wang/home/) since 2018. 

My research interests include: 1) examination and evaluation of heat dynamics in the urban area with cyberGIS and high-performance geospatial computing; 2) feature extraction using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data; and 3) scientific gateway construction for accessing high-performance computer (HPC).
