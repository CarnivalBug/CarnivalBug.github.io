I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography at Virginia Tech. I received my Ph.D. and M.S. in Geography from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and a B.E. in Computer Engineering from the University of Hong Kong.

My research interests are centered around geospatial data science and computational science, with a particular focus on modeling multi-scale urban climate dynamics using heterogeneous geospatial big data. Specifically, my research work focuses on 1) geospatial data science for understanding multi-scale urban dynamics; 2) scalable spatial algorithms for solving complex geospatial problems; and 3) democratization of cyberGIS for data-intensive geographic research. A common thread in my research is in understanding geospatial problems in urban dynamics, health, and related fields with large geospatial data, remote sensing data, complexity science, and high-performance computing.
