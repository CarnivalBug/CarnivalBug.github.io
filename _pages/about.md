Fangzheng Lyu is an incoming Assistant Professor in the [Department of Geography](https://geography.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). Prior to that, he worked with Prof. [Shaowen Wang](https://ggis.illinois.edu/directory/profile/shaowen) at the [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital & Spatial Studies](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/) and [Institute for Geospatial Understanding through an Integrative Discovery Environment (I-GUIDE)](https://i-guide.io/). He received a Ph.D. in Geography (2024), an M.S. in Geography (2021) from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), and a B.E. in Computer Engineering (2018) from the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/).

His research interests are centered around **GIScience**, **geospatial data science** and **computational science**, with a particular focus on modeling multi-scale urban climate dynamics using heterogeneous geospatial big data. Specifically, his research work focuses on 1) geospatial data science for understanding multi-scale urban dynamics; 2) scalable spatial algorithms for solving complex geospatial problems; and 3) democratization of cyberGIS for data-intensive geographic research. A common thread in his research is in understanding geospatial problems in urban dynamics, urban planning, health, and related fields with geospatial big data, cyberGIS, geospatial AI and high-performance geospatial computing.
