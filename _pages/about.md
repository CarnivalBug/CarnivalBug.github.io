I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the [Department of Geography](https://geography.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech. Prior to that, I worked at the [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital & Spatial Studies](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/) and [Institute for Geospatial Understanding through an Integrative Discovery Environment (I-GUIDE)](https://i-guide.io/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I received a Ph.D. in Geography (2024), an M.S. in Geography (2021) from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and a B.E. in Computer Engineering (2018) from the University of Hong Kong.

My research interests are centered around GIScience, geospatial data science and computational science, with a particular focus on modeling multi-scale urban climate dynamics using heterogeneous geospatial big data. Specifically, my research work focuses on 1) geospatial data science for understanding multi-scale urban dynamics; 2) scalable spatial algorithms for solving complex geospatial problems; and 3) democratization of cyberGIS for data-intensive geographic research. A common thread in my research is in understanding geospatial problems in urban dynamics, health, and related fields with large geospatial data, cyberGIS, machine learning and high-performance geospatial computing.
