I am a ***Geospatial Data Scientist*** and ***Computational Geographer*** studying ***Complex Geospatial Problems*** and ***Multi-scale Urban Dynamics***. Currently, I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate studying Geographical Information Science under the amazing [Dr. Shaowen Wang](https://ggis.illinois.edu/directory/profile/shaowen) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). And I also joined [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/) and 
[CyberInfrastructure and Geospatial Information Laboratory](https://cigi.illinois.edu/shaowen-wang/home/) since 2018. 

I got my B.E. in Computer Engineering from the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) in 2018. After undergrad, my interest in maps and spatial analysis brought me to [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), where I got my MSc in Geography and Geographical Information Science in 2021.

My research aims to advance cyberGIS and geospatial data science for solving complex geospatial problems and understanding multi-scale urban dynamics. Specifically, my research work focuses on 1) geospatial data science for understanding urban dynamics; 2) scalable spatial algorithms for solving complex geospatial problems; and 3) democratization of cyberGIS for data-intensive geographic research.
