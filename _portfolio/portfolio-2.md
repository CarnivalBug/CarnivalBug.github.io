<h2>Drainage Network Analysis</h2>

Drainage network analysis is fundamental to understanding the characteristics of surface hydrology. Based on elevation data, drainage network analysis is often used to extract key hydrological features like drainage networks and streamlines. Limited by raster-based data models, conventional drainage network algorithms typically allow water to flow in 4 or 8 directions (surrounding grids) from a raster grid. To resolve this limitation, we describe a new vector-based method for drainage network analysis that allows water to flow in any direction around each location. The method is enabled by rapid advances in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing and high-performance computing. The drainage network analysis is conducted using a high-density point cloud instead of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at coarse resolutions
